**REST API Test Automation Framework** : 
This Test Automation Framework is created using Java + TestNG + RestAssured which can be used across different api based applications. In this approach, 
the endeavor is to wrap the common requirements of API's for specific application within the wrapper class in order to test the API's without spending 
any extra efforts on common requirements. With this framework in place, whenever we need to automate API's, we would not need to start from scratch, 
and begin with developing the test cases straight away.
